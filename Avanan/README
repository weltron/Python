# Simple File System Simulation Instructions

This project implements a basic simulation of a file system using Python. The simulation provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the file system, supporting commands such as 'ls', 'cd', 'pwd', 'touch', and 'mkdir'.

## How it works

1. Run the script using Python:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

2. Once the script is running, you can enter commands at the prompt:

    - `ls`: List the contents of the current directory.
    - `cd [path]`: Change the current directory to the specified path or move to the parent directory using `cd ..`.
    - `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
    - `mkdir [directory_name]`: Create a new directory.
    - `touch [file_name]`: Create a new file.
    - `exit`: Exit the simulation.

## Examples

- To create a new directory:

    ```
    $ mkdir documents
    ```

- To change to the 'documents' directory:

    ```
    $ cd documents
    ```

- To list the contents of the current directory:

    ```
    $ ls
    ```

- To print the current directory path:

    ```
    $ pwd
    ```

- To create a new file:

    ```
    $ touch file.txt
    ```

## Notes

- Directories and files are simulated in-memory; no actual file system operations are performed.
